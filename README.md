# ecbs5241
Final project for ECBS 5241 Coding for Economists

## Learning Outcomes to Demonstrate
1. Understand folder structure. Perform operations on files in different folders.

    `pwd` prints working directory, `cd` changes the directory. Pressing Tab button after `cd` lets the user easily find the needed directory.

2. Automate repeating tasks using Python “for” loops.
    
    demonstrated in py_exercises.ipynb

3. Break up work into smaller components using Python functions.
    
    demonstrated in py_exercises.ipynb

4. Use Python “lists” and “dictionaries” appropriately. Demonstrate one of the two.
    
    demonstrated in py_exercises.ipynb

5. Automate repeating tasks using Stata “for” loops.

    demonstrated in code/data_cleaning.do

6. Break up work into smaller components using Stata .do files.

    demonstrated in code/master.do
    
7. Read .csv data in in Stata.

    demonstrated in code/data_cleaning.do
    
8. Fix common data quality errors in Stata (for example, string vs number, missing value).

    demonstrated in code/data_cleaning.do
    
9. Aggregate, reshape, and combine data for analysis in Python or Stata. Demonstrate at least one of these data manipulations.
    
    demonstrated in py_exercises.ipynb

10. Prepare a sample for analysis by filtering observations and variables and creating transformations of variables. Demonstrate all three.
    
    demonstrated in py_exercises.ipynb

11. Save data in Stata.

    demonstrated in code/figures.do
    demonstrated in code/regression.do
    demonstrated in code/summary.do

12. Run ordinary least squares regression in Stata.
    
    demonstrated in code/regression.do

13. Create a graph (of any type) in State.
    
    demonstrated in code/figures.do

14. Save regression tables and graphs as files. Demonstrate both.
    
    demonstrated in code/regression.do
    demonstrated in code/figures.do

15. Install a Stata package. (Can be the same as we already did in class.)
    
    demonstrated in code/packages.do

16. Commit files into git version control.
    
    demonstrated by the fact that they are there xD

17. Name files, functions and variables appropriately.
18. Write helpful comments and commit messages. Demonstrate both.
19. Push a repository to GitHub.
20. Explain how to reproduce your work with short instructions or a self-documenting master script.
