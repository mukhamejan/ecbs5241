# ecbs5241
Final project for ECBS 5241 Coding for Economists

## Learning Outcomes to Demonstrate
1. Understand folder structure. Perform operations on files in different folders.
2. Automate repeating tasks using Python “for” loops.
3. Break up work into smaller components using Python functions.
4. Use Python “lists” and “dictionaries” appropriately. Demonstrate one of the two.
5. Automate repeating tasks using Stata “for” loops.
6. Break up work into smaller components using Stata .do files.
7. Read .csv data in in Stata.
8. Fix common data quality errors in Stata (for example, string vs number, missing value).
9. Aggregate, reshape, and combine data for analysis in Python or Stata. Demonstrate at least one of these data manipulations.
10. Prepare a sample for analysis by filtering observations and variables and creating transformations of variables. Demonstrate all three.
11. Save data in Stata.
12. Run ordinary least squares regression in Stata.
13. Create a graph (of any type) in State.
14. Save regression tables and graphs as files. Demonstrate both.
15. Install a Stata package. (Can be the same as we already did in class.)
16. Commit files into git version control.
17. Name files, functions and variables appropriately.
18. Write helpful comments and commit messages. Demonstrate both.
19. Push a repository to GitHub.
20. Explain how to reproduce your work with short instructions or a self-documenting master script.
